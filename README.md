## What This Is

**Light Omens** is a narrative-forward tabletop roleplaying game about hope under pressure, power with consequences, and the choices people make when light itself can harm the world.

This repository contains the **digital-first ashcan edition** of Light Omens. It serves two connected purposes:

- A playable early version of the RPG’s rules, setting, and themes
- A modern web platform built to support reading, character tools, and future play features

The project is designed for playtesting, iteration, and long-term growth.

---

## The Game at a Glance

Light Omens is a grim fantasy RPG where players take on the role of **Seekers**. These are people who step forward when institutions fail and certainty collapses.

You play in a world where:

- Hope exists, but must be chosen
- Power can heal, protect, or destroy
- Every solution creates new problems
- Refusing to act is still a decision

The game emphasizes meaningful consequences, shared narrative authority, and moral tension over optimization or power fantasy.

---

## You Play Seekers

Seekers are not destined heroes or crowned rulers.

They are:

- Explorers of forgotten places
- Protectors of vulnerable communities
- Negotiators between rival factions
- Bearers of the **Grim Light**, a force capable of miracles and ruin

Seekers matter because they act. The world does not change on its own.

---

## Light, Shadow, and Choice

At the heart of Light Omens is a simple truth:

**Light and shadow are entangled.**

- Light represents hope, clarity, protection, and possibility
- Shadow represents fear, loss, corruption, and the cost of survival

Neither can be erased. Every meaningful choice exists between them.

---

## The Grim Light

The Grim Light is the defining force of the setting. It can:

- Heal the dying
- Power ancient machines
- Hold back monstrous threats
- Reveal hidden truths

Every use leaves a mark.

The Grim Light demands sacrifice, escalates conflict, and reshapes the world in irreversible ways. Using it is never neutral. Refusing it is not without consequence.

---

## Tone and Play Style

Light Omens supports a range of emotional tones.

- **Hopepunk:** communities can be saved, sacrifice matters, small victories inspire change
- **Grimdark:** survival is costly, power corrupts easily, hope must be fought for every day

Before play, decide where your table sits and revisit that choice as the story evolves.

## Core Narrative Tools (High Level)

### Truths

Concise, actionable facts such as _Collapsed Bridge_, _Trusted by the Locals_, or _Fractured Resolve_.

Truths define what is possible, create opportunities and obstacles, and change as the world changes.

### Momentum and Chaos

Action creates pressure.

- Momentum represents advantage gained through preparation and decisive action
- Chaos represents escalation, complication, and fallout

As Momentum rises, temptation grows. As Chaos spreads, the world pushes back.

### Hope

A Seeker’s inner resolve. Hope is fragile, personal, and powerful. It can be spent to change outcomes and restored through connection, meaning, and hard-won victories.

Hope does not deny darkness. It insists action still matters.

---

## Session Rhythm

Most sessions loosely follow this cycle:

1. Investigate the problem and hidden pressures
2. Journey through danger and discovery
3. Confront a threat, disaster, or hard truth
4. Claim or save something at a cost
5. Return changed as the world responds

This is a guide, not a script.

## Digital-First Platform

This project is built as a living platform that evolves alongside the game.

**Tech overview:**

- React with Vite
- React Router with nested routes and guarded app areas
- Vanilla CSS organized by responsibility
- Static deployment via GitHub Pages

The codebase is structured to demonstrate clean routing, layout separation, and scalable front-end architecture. While this is a game project first, it also serves as a professional portfolio example of modern front-end development.

Light Omens is still becoming what it will be.
